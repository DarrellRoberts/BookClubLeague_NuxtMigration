## Book Club League
The Book CLub League is a platform that displays data from various book clubs across the world.

Users can compare metrics from their club with others, such as: book ratings, number of books read and more.

It adds a competitive element and pushes book club members to be more active and engaging.

This is the frontend where I am using Nuxt 3 with Tailwind CSS.

One of my current projects so stay tuned for screenshots and more!

Cheers, Darrell
